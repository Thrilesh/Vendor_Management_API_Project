**Features**

**1. Vendor Profile Management**
Model Design: A model to store vendor information, including name, contact details, address, and a unique vendor code.
API Endpoints:
POST /api/vendors/: Create a new vendor.
GET /api/vendors/: List all vendors.
GET /api/vendors/{vendor_id}/: Retrieve a specific vendor's details.
PUT /api/vendors/{vendor_id}/: Update a vendor's details.
DELETE /api/vendors/{vendor_id}/: Delete a vendor.

**2. Purchase Order Tracking**
Model Design: Track purchase orders with fields like PO number, vendor reference, order date, items, quantity, and status.
API Endpoints:
POST /api/purchase_orders/: Create a purchase order.
GET /api/purchase_orders/: List all purchase orders with an option to filter by vendor.
GET /api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/: Retrieve details of a specific purchase order.
PUT /api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/: Update a purchase order.
DELETE /api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/: Delete a purchase order.

**3. Vendor Performance Evaluation**
Metrics:
On-Time Delivery Rate: Percentage of orders delivered by the promised date.
Quality Rating: Average of quality ratings given to a vendorâ€™s purchase orders.
Response Time: Average time taken by a vendor to acknowledge or respond to purchase orders.
Fulfilment Rate: Percentage of purchase orders fulfilled without issues.
Model Design: Fields added to the vendor model to store these performance metrics.
API Endpoints:
GET /api/vendors/{vendor_id}/performance: Retrieve a vendor's performance metrics.
Data Models
Vendor Model
This model stores essential information about each vendor and their performance metrics.
**
Fields:**
name: CharField - Vendor's name.
contact_details: TextField - Contact information of the vendor.
address: TextField - Physical address of the vendor.
vendor_code: CharField - A unique identifier for the vendor.
on_time_delivery_rate: FloatField - Tracks the percentage of on-time deliveries.
quality_rating_avg: FloatField - Average rating of quality based on purchase orders.
average_response_time: FloatField - Average time taken to acknowledge purchase orders.
fulfillment_rate: FloatField - Percentage of purchase orders fulfilled successfully.
Purchase Order (PO) Model
This model captures the details of each purchase order and is used to calculate various performance metrics.

**Fields:**
po_number: CharField - Unique number identifying the PO.
vendor: ForeignKey - Link to the Vendor model.
order_date: DateTimeField - Date when the order was placed.
delivery_date: DateTimeField - Expected or actual delivery date of the order.
items: JSONField - Details of items ordered.
quantity: IntegerField - Total quantity of items in the PO.
status: CharField - Current status of the PO (e.g., pending, completed, canceled).
quality_rating: FloatField - Rating given to the vendor for this PO (nullable).
issue_date: DateTimeField - Timestamp when the PO was issued to the vendor.
acknowledgment_date: DateTimeField, nullable - Timestamp when the vendor acknowledged the PO.
Historical Performance Model
This model optionally stores historical data on vendor performance, enabling trend analysis.

**Fields:**
vendor: ForeignKey - Link to the Vendor model.
date: DateTimeField - Date of the performance record.
on_time_delivery_rate: FloatField - Historical record of the on-time delivery rate.
quality_rating_avg: FloatField - Historical record of the quality rating average.
average_response_time: FloatField - Historical record of the average response time.
fulfillment_rate: FloatField - Historical record of the fulfilment rate.
These models form the backbone of the Vendor Management System, enabling comprehensive tracking and analysis of vendor performance over time. The performance metrics are updated based on interactions recorded in the Purchase Order model.

**Backend Logic for Performance Metrics**
On-Time Delivery Rate
Calculated each time a PO status changes to 'completed'.
Logic: Count the number of completed POs delivered on or before the delivery_date and divide by the total number of completed POs for that vendor.
Quality Rating Average
Updated upon the completion of each PO where a quality_rating is provided.
Logic: Calculate the average of all quality_rating values for completed POs of the vendor.
Average Response Time
Calculated each time a PO is acknowledged by the vendor.
Logic: Compute the time difference between issue_date and acknowledgment_date for each PO, and then find the average of these times for all POs of the vendor.
Fulfilment Rate
Calculated upon any change in PO status.
Logic: Divide the number of successfully fulfilled POs (status 'completed' without issues) by the total number of POs issued to the vendor.
API Endpoint Implementation
Vendor Performance Endpoint (GET /api/vendors/{vendor_id}/performance):

Retrieves the calculated performance metrics for a specific vendor.
Should return data including on_time_delivery_rate, quality_rating_avg, average_response_time, and fulfillment_rate.
Update Acknowledgment Endpoint:

While not explicitly detailed in the previous sections, consider an endpoint like POST /api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/acknowledge for vendors to acknowledge POs.
This endpoint will update acknowledgment_date and trigger the recalculation of average_response_time.
Additional Technical Considerations
Efficient Calculation:

Ensure that the logic for calculating metrics is optimized to handle large datasets without significant performance issues.
Data Integrity:

Include checks to handle scenarios like missing data points or division by zero in calculations.
Real-time Updates:

Consider using Django signals to trigger metric updates in real-time when related PO data is modified.
